#Analysis-Based-on-Execution-Time

#Objective

Analysis of algorithms based on their execution time based on that its graphical analysis
was done to provide a user clear view of the optimal algorithm which performed best on
each test case and its image deployment on docker hub.

#METHODOLOGY

1. Project Initiation
• Problem Statement identification
• Requirements gathering activity – All possible requirements of the Project to be developed are captured and documented.

2. Implementation of the Algorithm
Study different Algorithms which are
  (1) Sorting Algorithms
    a) Bubble Sort
    b) Selection Sort
    c) Merge Sort
    d) Insertion Sort
  (2) Disk Scheduling Algorithms
    a) FCFS (First Come First Serve)
    b) SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
    c) SCAN
    d) LOOK
    e) C-SCAN
    f) C-LOOK
  • Analyze the Algorithm
  • Finalize the Mathematical Approach of Algorithm
  • We are providing GUI with use of GTK Library
  
3. Coding
• After Finalizing Algorithm, Code is integrated with GTK library

4. Implementation of Docker
  • INSTALL
    (1) Here we install the Docker on OS.
  • CONFIGURE
    (1) Here we take a image of RedHat Operating System i.e. centos: latest
    (2) That image we configured by adding some library and some rules in it.
  • LAUNCH
    (1) Launch the Docker by giving GUI in to it and set Display to it.

5. Testing
• All the modules developed are integrated into a system after testing of each unit.
• All possible test cases are verified for final program developed.

6. Commit and Upload Image
• After Testing Phase, we commit that Docker image.
• And that image we upload on Docker Hub.
